![Developer × Researcher: Building production-grade AI Assurance](assets/gitprofile_banner.png)

# Kavita Jadhav

**Trustworthy AI • LLM Testing • Full-Stack Automation**

I am an **AI Developer and Test Engineer (12+ years)** working at the intersection of **software engineering** and **AI assurance**. My research-oriented work focuses on converting probabilistic model behavior into **repeatable experiments** and **measurable evidence**—so AI-enabled systems remain **reliable under change** and **auditable in production**.

I design and build evaluation and automation systems that move beyond *“does it work?”* to answer: **is it safe, stable, and defensible under real-world conditions?**

## Research interests

My current interests focus on **reliability, safety, and governance-aligned evaluation** for LLM-enabled systems:

- **LLM evaluation methodology & benchmarking**
  - Reproducible harness design, multi-model comparisons, metric selection, regression protocols  
- **Failure mode characterization**
  - Hallucination patterns, prompt sensitivity, bias/fairness gaps, context-window limits, behavioral drift  
- **Adversarial testing & red teaming**
  - Prompt injection, jailbreak resilience, adversarial formatting/obfuscation, privacy/PII leakage, unsafe content pathways  
- **Robustness & production monitoring**
  - Drift detection signals, stability under distribution shift, reliability scorecards, audit-friendly evidence trails  
- **Evaluation in CI/CD**
  - Automated quality gates, traceable results, compliance-aligned test suites, reproducible reporting  
- **AI integration in legacy test automation frameworks**
  - Adding AI-assisted capabilities to existing Selenium/BDD/API frameworks (test generation, self-healing, intelligent assertions, flaky-test reduction) while maintaining determinism, traceability, and maintainable architecture  
- **AI application development & end-to-end validation**
  - Building and testing AI-enabled applications (RAG, agents/tool use, MCP-based integrations), with emphasis on observability, data/privacy controls, and evaluation-driven development

## What I build

- **Evaluation harnesses** and test suites for accuracy, faithfulness, safety, and compliance  
- **Full-stack validation** across UI + API + DB integrated into CI/CD pipelines  
- **Reliability artifacts**: scorecards, benchmark runs, failure-mode matrices, audit-friendly reporting  
- Frameworks that prioritize **testability-by-design** and production realism
