![Developer × Researcher: Building production-grade AI Assurance](assets/banner.png)

# Kavita Jadhav

**Trustworthy AI • LLM Testing • Full-Stack Automation**

I am an **AI Developer and Test Engineer (12+ years)** working at the intersection of **software engineering** and **AI assurance**. My research-oriented work focuses on converting probabilistic model behavior into **repeatable experiments** and **measurable evidence**—so AI-enabled systems remain **reliable under change** and **auditable in production**.

I design and build evaluation and automation systems that move beyond *“does it work?”* to answer: **is it safe, stable, and defensible under real-world conditions?**

## Start here (research + build artifacts)

- **LLM Testing Hub**  
  - 🔗 https://github.com/K11-Software-Solutions/llm-testing-hub  
  *A practical research hub for LLM assurance—evaluation harnesses, regression suites, red-teaming scenarios, and reliability scorecards for repeatable, audit-ready testing.*

- **Enterprise Test Automation Frameworks**
  - 🔗 https://github.com/K11-Software-Solutions/k11TechLab-selenium-java-fullstack-framework  
*Selenium + Java full-stack automation framework emphasizing modular design, reporting, and repeatable execution patterns for enterprise delivery—extended with **AI-assisted testing** and **AI integration** patterns (e.g., prompt-driven test generation, self-healing strategies, and evaluation hooks for AI/LLM-enabled workflows).*

  - 🔗 https://github.com/K11-Software-Solutions/k11TechLab-cucumber-bdd-java-fullstack-framework  
  *Cucumber BDD framework for scalable automation across UI + API+ Mobile Apps workflows, built for CI/CD and long-term maintainability.*

- **Full-Stack Engineering (Portfolio apps)**

    https://github.com/kavitaj11/apollonia-dental-practice-employee-management-system-CRUD-web-app  
    *Full-stack CRUD application demonstrating end-to-end delivery.*

  - 🔗 **Greenspot Grocer – Relational Database Transformation Project**  
    https://github.com/kavitaj11/greenspot-grocery-portfolio-database-project  
    *Data modeling + normalization + scalable DB design from flat datasets.*

- **Modern UI Automation**
  - 🔗 **AI-Powered Playwright Python Framework** *(Under Development)*  
    *A research-driven Playwright + PyTest framework augmented with AI-assisted testing (test generation, self-healing locators, intelligent assertions) and optional LLM evaluation hooks for AI-enabled workflows.*

## Research interests

My current interests focus on **reliability, safety, and governance-aligned evaluation** for LLM-enabled systems:

- **LLM evaluation methodology & benchmarking**
  - Reproducible harness design, multi-model comparisons, metric selection, regression protocols  
- **Failure mode characterization**
  - Hallucination patterns, prompt sensitivity, bias/fairness gaps, context-window limits, behavioral drift  
- **Adversarial testing & red teaming**
  - Prompt injection, jailbreak resilience, adversarial formatting/obfuscation, privacy/PII leakage, unsafe content pathways  
- **Robustness & production monitoring**
  - Drift detection signals, stability under distribution shift, reliability scorecards, audit-friendly evidence trails  
- **Evaluation in CI/CD**
  - Automated quality gates, traceable results, compliance-aligned test suites, reproducible reporting  
- **AI integration in legacy test automation frameworks**
  - Adding AI-assisted capabilities to existing Selenium/BDD/API frameworks (test generation, self-healing, intelligent assertions, flaky-test reduction) while maintaining determinism, traceability, and maintainable architecture  
- **AI application development & end-to-end validation**
  - Building and testing AI-enabled applications (RAG, agents/tool use, MCP-based integrations), with emphasis on observability, data/privacy controls, and evaluation-driven development
