**Trustworthy AI • LLM Testing • Full-Stack Automation**

I am an **AI Developer and Test Engineer (12+ years)** working at the intersection of **software engineering** and **AI assurance**. My research-oriented work focuses on converting probabilistic model behavior into **repeatable experiments** and **measurable evidence**—so AI-enabled systems remain **reliable under change** and **auditable in production**.

I design and build evaluation and automation systems that move beyond *“does it work?”* to answer: **is it safe, stable, and defensible under real-world conditions?**

## Research interests

My current research focuses on **AI assurance for LLM-enabled systems**, including:

- **LLM evaluation & benchmarking:** reproducible harnesses, multi-model comparisons, metric design, regression protocols  
- **AI red teaming & safety testing:** prompt injection, jailbreak resilience, adversarial formatting/obfuscation, privacy/PII leakage  
- **Robustness & reliability:** hallucination patterns, prompt sensitivity, context-window limits, drift detection, stability under distribution shift  
- **Evaluation in CI/CD:** automated gates, audit-ready artifacts, reliability scorecards, traceability for production systems

## What I build

- **Evaluation harnesses** and test suites for accuracy, faithfulness, safety, and compliance  
- **Full-stack validation** across UI + API + DB integrated into CI/CD pipelines  
- **Reliability artifacts**: scorecards, benchmark runs, failure-mode matrices, audit-friendly reporting  
- Frameworks that prioritize **testability-by-design** and production realism
